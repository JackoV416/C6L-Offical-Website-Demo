  <h2>Joining the Civilization VI League Community (tCL)</h2>
  <p>We value competitiveness, fairness, positive attitudes, with attention to teaching here. </p>
  <p>Cooperation is key, and would love to play with players who want to be in a long-term invested community. </p>
  <p>Expect playing with players who encourage other players to not quit, as that is something we'd like to stray from. </p>
  <p>It creates an imbalance in the game, and can easily shift the winners which determines a different outcome. </p>
  <p>AI are geneerally aweful at the game, and are easily manipulated. </p>
  <p>Recieve a great deal of joy knowing your games will go on the record, wins/losses will help you determine how well you are doing in the league's standings. </p>
  <p>As well as learning what needs improving in your skills to be even better.</p>
  <p>We hope to share these qualities with each and every member of our community, as you will experience a better gaming format for Civilization VI !</p>
